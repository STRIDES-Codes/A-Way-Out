<h1 style="color:blue;"> <b>A Way Out</b>: Pandemic preparedness in context of health disparities to limit disproportionate morbidity and mortality</h1>

##### Authors: Lead: Udana Torian - SysAdmin: Shreya Shah - Writers: Ashley Bamfo, Dinh Nguyen, Vincent La

## Why pandemic preparedness?
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the disproportionate impact on BIPOC (Black and Indigenous People of Color) communities has been catastrophic. Generations of health disparities manifest in wide-spread co-morbidities such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes(1) have made these communities extremely vulnerable. Compounding the problem is the often lack of adequate medical resources within the community. All of these factors have created a preparedness vacuum leaving the most vulnerable of society exposed, infected, and dead.

## Our approach
In an effort to address these health disparities in pandemic preparedness, we aim to aid _____ in deciding where and how to distribute resources equitably by constructing a ______ composite index and to assess which communities may be more vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID pandemic.


## Methods:
### Data Sources:

+ Demographic | <a href="">DATASET TITLE</a>
+ Comorbidities | <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-P/dttw-5yxu/data">Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) from CDC</a>
+ Social Determinants of Health | <a href="">DATASET TITLE</a>

### Outcome
Mortality and morbidity of minority populations in the U.S. (cases and deaths).

### Study variables
These variables included comorbidities of a presence of hypertension, obesity, or diabetes diagnosis. 

### Technologies:
<br>
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ Python
+ Pandas
+ NumPy
+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn 
+ Copy
+ Json
+ RStudio
+ dplyr
+ STATA

## Output:
_____IMAGE OF SCORE / MAGNITUDE OF CORRELATION_____

## Planned Features
1. Build a UI for streamlining data input.
2. Develop more granularity for county/district-level vulnerabilty information.
3. Integration of more variables

## Limitations
State-level data has it's limitations in helping decision-making at the national level. Data sources such as BRFSS are limited to participants who are able to respond via landline or cellphone line due to the nature of the data collection methods.
